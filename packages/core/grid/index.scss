// Grid
//
// Reuse bootstrap grid but don't import it directly, just use its mixins
// condensed in shortand formats like
//
// ```scss
// @include Col(md, 6); // same as HTML class .col-md-6
// @include Offset(md, 2); // same as HTML class .offset-md-2
// ```
// Provide also row and containers classes as they produce a limited amount of
// CSS and provide a generic name for markup elements which might be hard to
// name otherwise.
// We import it in any case as the output is controlled by the SCSS variable
// `$Grid-classes` which defaultts to `false` here.
//

@import "bootstrap/grid";

%Container {
  @include make-container($Grid-gutter);
}

// output helpers row and container classes only if the full Bootstrap's grid
// framework is not enabled
@if not $Grid-classes {
  .row {
    // as in Bootstrap
    @extend %Row;
  }
}

// simpler than Bootstrap, just outputs classes for containers fixed to their
// given max width as defined in the `$Container-widths` SASS map
@each $breakpoint, $width in $Container-widths {
  .container-#{$breakpoint} {
    @extend %Container;
    max-width: $width;
  }
}
